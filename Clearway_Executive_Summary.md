# CLEARWAY - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
## Data Infrastructure for Alternative Investments

**Date:** November 18, 2025  
 

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

$50B flows through alternative investments annually across 100,000+ fund-to-investor relationships. **Every transaction is 100% manual:**
- Fund administrators email PDFs
- RIAs manually type data into systems  
- Investors get stale data 60+ days late
- CPAs reconstruct everything for taxes

**We're automating the entire flow with AI + API infrastructure.**

---

## THE SOLUTION: MULTI-SIDED PLATFORM

```
SUPPLY SIDE                    CLEARWAY                    DEMAND SIDE
Fund Administrators    →    Data Infrastructure    →    RIAs, Investors, CPAs
(500 fund admins)              (API Platform)            (58,000+ customers)
```

**Network Effects:** More RIAs → More valuable to fund admins → More admins integrate → More data → Better AI → More RIAs
